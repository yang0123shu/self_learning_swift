   - @ObservedObject and @StateObject
   - @EnvironmentObject for shared state
   - Best practices and patterns

### Example Projects
Complete, working apps you can build and customize:

1. **[Counter App](/Example-Projects/01-Counter-App.md)**
   - Simple state management
   - Button interactions
   - Conditional styling
   - Perfect first SwiftUI project

2. **[Todo List App](/Example-Projects/02-Todo-List-App.md)**
   - MVVM architecture
   - Data modeling with Codable
   - List operations (add, delete, complete)
   - Priority system with color coding
   - Forms and validation

3. **[Weather App](/Example-Projects/03-Weather-App.md)**
   - API integration
   - Async/await networking
   - JSON decoding
   - Error handling
   - Beautiful gradient UI
   - Loading states

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Mac** with macOS (required for Xcode)
- **Xcode** 14.0 or later ([Download from Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835))
- Basic programming knowledge (helpful but not required)

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yang0123shu/self_learning_swift.git
   cd self_learning_swift
   ```

2. Start with Swift Basics if you're new to Swift
3. Move on to SwiftUI Basics once comfortable with Swift
4. Build the example projects to practice

## üí° How to Use This Tutorial

### For Each Lesson
1. **Read** the tutorial markdown file
2. **Type out** the code examples (don't copy-paste!)
3. **Experiment** by modifying the examples
4. **Complete** the practice exercises at the end
5. **Build** something small using what you learned

### For Each Project
1. **Read** the complete project overview
2. **Create** a new Xcode project
3. **Type** the code and understand each part
4. **Run** the project and test all features
5. **Extend** it with the suggested exercises

### Tips for Success
- ‚úÖ Code every day, even if just for 15 minutes
- ‚úÖ Type code instead of copying to build muscle memory
- ‚úÖ Break when frustrated, come back fresh
- ‚úÖ Join Swift communities for help and motivation
- ‚úÖ Build your own projects once you complete the tutorials
- ‚ùå Don't rush through lessons
- ‚ùå Don't skip the practice exercises
- ‚ùå Don't just read - write code!
