# Getting Started - Complete Beginner's Guide

Welcome to Swift and SwiftUI! This guide will help you get everything set up and write your first program.

## What You'll Need

### 1. A Mac Computer
- Swift and SwiftUI development requires macOS
- Any Mac from the last few years will work fine
- At least 8GB of RAM recommended (16GB ideal)
- At least 20GB of free disk space

### 2. Xcode (Free!)
Xcode is Apple's development environment for building iOS, macOS, and other Apple platform apps.

#### Installing Xcode
1. Open the **App Store** on your Mac
2. Search for "**Xcode**"
3. Click **Get** or the download button (it's free!)
4. Wait for the download (it's large, ~10-15GB, so it might take a while)
5. Once installed, open Xcode
6. Agree to the license agreement
7. Wait for additional components to install

## Your First Swift Program

### Option 1: Swift Playground (Fastest Way to Start)

1. Open **Xcode**
2. Select **File → New → Playground**
3. Choose **Blank** template
4. Name it "MyFirstPlayground"
5. Click **Create**

You'll see something like this:
```swift
import Cocoa

var greeting = "Hello, playground"
```

6. Delete everything and type:
```swift
print("Hello, World!")
print("I'm learning Swift!")

let myName = "Your Name"
print("My name is \(myName)")

let currentYear = 2024
let birthYear = 2000
let age = currentYear - birthYear
print("I am \(age) years old")
```

7. Click the **Play** button (▶️) or press **⌘ + Shift + Return**
8. See the output in the right panel!

### Option 2: Your First SwiftUI App

1. Open **Xcode**
2. Select **File → New → Project**
3. Choose **iOS** and **App** template
4. Click **Next**
5. Fill in:
   - Product Name: `MyFirstApp`
   - Interface: `SwiftUI`
   - Language: `Swift`
6. Click **Next**
7. Choose where to save it
8. Click **Create**

You'll see a file called `ContentView.swift` with:
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

9. Click the **Resume** button in the preview panel (right side)
10. You should see your app preview!

### Modify Your First App

Replace the code with:
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Text("Welcome to SwiftUI!")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .bold()
            
            TextField("Enter your name", text: $name)
                .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
                .padding()
            
            if !name.isEmpty {
                Text("Hello, \(name)!")
                    .font(.title)
                    .foregroundColor(.blue)
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

Watch the preview update automatically!

## Understanding Xcode

### Main Areas

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Navigator (Left)    │  Editor (Center)  │ Preview      │
│                      │                   │ (Right)      │
│  Project files       │  Your code here   │              │
│  and structure       │                   │  Live        │
│                      │                   │  preview     │
│                      │                   │              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Debug Area (Bottom) - Shows output and errors          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Essential Buttons

- **▶️ Run** - Build and run your app (⌘ + R)
- **⏹️ Stop** - Stop running app (⌘ + .)
- **🔨 Build** - Compile your code (⌘ + B)
- **📱 Simulator Menu** - Choose which device to test on

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. Typos and Case Sensitivity
❌ Wrong:
```swift
Print("Hello")      // 'P' should be lowercase
let Name = "John"   // Variables usually start with lowercase
```

✅ Correct:
```swift
print("Hello")
let name = "John"
```

### 2. Missing Closing Braces
❌ Wrong:
```swift
func greet() {
    print("Hello")
// Missing closing brace!
```

✅ Correct:
```swift
func greet() {
    print("Hello")
}
```

### 3. Trying to Change Constants
❌ Wrong:
```swift
let age = 25
age = 26  // Error! Can't change a 'let' constant
```

✅ Correct:
```swift
var age = 25
age = 26  // OK! 'var' can be changed
```

### 4. Forgetting the $ for Bindings
❌ Wrong (SwiftUI):
```swift
@State private var text = ""
TextField("Enter text", text: text)  // Missing $
```

✅ Correct:
```swift
@State private var text = ""
TextField("Enter text", text: $text)  // Correct with $
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Preview not showing
**Solution:**
1. Click the **Resume** button in the preview panel
2. Make sure you're in `ContentView.swift` or a SwiftUI file
3. Try ⌘ + Option + P to refresh preview

### Problem: Red errors in code
**Solution:**
1. Read the error message (click on the red icon)
2. Most errors are typos or missing braces
3. Check that all opening `{` have closing `}`
4. Make sure all strings are in quotes `"like this"`

### Problem: Simulator not responding
**Solution:**
1. Stop the app (⌘ + .)
2. Restart Xcode
3. In Xcode menu: Product → Clean Build Folder
4. Try running again

### Problem: "Developer disk image not found"
**Solution:**
- Update Xcode to the latest version
- Or use a simulator instead of physical device
